# BIE_PNP_1D
An integral equation method is presented for the 1D steady-state Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations modeling ion transport through membrane channels. The differential equations are recast as integral equations using Green's 3rd identity yielding a fixed-point problem  for the electric potential gradient and ion concentrations. The integrals are discretized by a combination of midpoint and trapezoid rules and the resulting algebraic equations are solved by Gummel iteration. Numerical tests for electroneutral and non-electroneutral systems demonstrate the method's 2nd order accuracy and ability to resolve sharp boundary layers. The method is applied to a 1D model of the potassium ion channel with a fixed charge density that ensures cation selectivity. In these tests the proposed integral equation method yields potential and concentration profiles in good agreement with published results. More details can be found https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04371.
